		<p class="text-lg mb-8" style="opacity: 0.8">
			Hi, I'm Michael, the sole developer and creative force behind somefreq. With nearly 20 years
			of experience in graphic design and programming, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide
			range of projects that blend creativity with technical expertise. I began my career as a
			graphic designer, specializing in branding and teaching classes for SMEs and personal brands.
			I then moved on to designing and coding emails for Studio.co.uk before co-running an
			internationally renowned photography business for almost a decade, where I wrote and
			maintained various apps for the business. As a polyglot programmer, I'm comfortable working
			with multiple languages, always choosing the best tools for the job. Currently, I'm pursuing a
			Master's in Computer Science to further hone my skills. Whether it's a blog, e-commerce site,
			portfolio, or a complex web app like a SaaS product, I'm excited to help bring your ideas to
			life.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg mb-8" style="opacity: 0.8">
			While I work independently, I believe in delivering the best possible results for every
			project. If a project requires specialised expertise, I collaborate with a network of trusted
			professionals to ensure that your vision is fully realised. My goal is to provide a seamless,
			personal experience where you always have direct access to the person making your ideas come
			to life.
