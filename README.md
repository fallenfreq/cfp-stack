# Tech Stack Monorepo

## Overview

This repository is a monorepo for a web application using a modern tech stack. It includes:

- **TypeScript**
- **Vue 3**
- **Vuestic UI**
- **PrimeVue (unstyled with Tailwind)**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vite**
- **Zitadel**
- **tRPC**
- **Drizzle ORM**
- **Docker**
- **Nginx**

## Setup

### Certificates

Ensure that `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` certificates exist in the `./certs` directory. For development purposes, you can generate a certificate authority and self-signed certificates using the scripts provided in the `./certs` directory. Dont forgot to let your OS or browser trust your CA file.

### Environment Variables

Create a copy of any `.example` files and fill them in, removing the `.example` extension. For example, `.env.example` becomes `.env`.

### Docker

Run `docker-compose up` to start Zitadel, the necessary databases, and the API, which also serves the Vue 3 client. Docker is intended as an option for deploying the API and sits behind Nginx as a reverse proxy. Zitadel is always started as a container and has its own network, including Nginx, databases, etc.

### Authentication

Zitadel needs to be running for the login button to work.
You'll also need to login to the Zitadel console, create a Vue app to login to, create an API app for the api to do token inspection and add the appropriate .env vars to the client and api .env files.

You can see more information on how to login to a single page application with Zitadel [here](https://zitadel.com/docs/examples/login/vue).

You can see more information on how we secure the API routes with Zitadel via token inspection and how to set up the API app in Zitadel [here](https://zitadel.com/blog/testing-token-introspection-with-postman).

### tRPC Endpoints

Prefix the tRPC endpoints with `/trpc`. Unprefixed URLs will serve the client and client assets.

#### Example tRPC Endpoint:

[https://localhost/trpc/echo?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22from%20tRPC%22%7D%7D%7D](https://localhost/trpc/echo?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22from%20tRPC%22%7D%7D%7D)

Although there is no need to visit tRPC enpoints manually since you make queries using trpc instead of something like axios.

```typescript
trpc.secure.test
  .query('Sending data to tRPC secure endpoint from Vue client')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('tRPC secure response', response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

#### Example Vue Route:

[https://localhost/vuestic-demo](https://localhost/vuestic-demo)

## Development Commands

- **Start Zitadel:** `pnpm docker:up:zitadel`
- **Start Development Database:** `pnpm db:api`
- **Install Dependencies:** `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist`
- **Build API and Client:** `pnpm build`
- **Start API and Vite Dev Server:** `pnpm dev`

### Ports

- Zitadel: `https://localhost:4443`
- Vite Dev Server: `http://localhost:5173`

## Integration Details

The framework currently integrates Vuestic and PrimeVue.

### Tailwind and PrimeVue

PrimeVue components are unstyled and used with Tailwind. We cannot use `tailwindcss-primeui` until PrimeVue v4 supports Tailwind presets.

- [Tailwind CSS PrimeUI](https://github.com/primefaces/tailwindcss-primeui)
- [PrimeVue Tailwind](https://primevue.org/tailwind/)

### Tailwind and Vuestic

Read more about integrating Tailwind with Vuestic [here](https://ui.vuestic.dev/styles/tailwind).

The `client/cssVariables.js` file is generated by `client/plugins/extractCssVars.ts` so that variables can be accessed and passed to the `vuestic.config.js` to avoid duplicating color definitions. The commands below might override the `vuestic.config.js` file, which should be avoided.

#### Synchronization Commands:

- **Sync Tailwind with Vuestic:** `npx sync-tailwind-with-vuestic`

  - Formats and transfers the color and breakpoint settings from `tailwind.config.*` to `vuestic.config.js`.

- **Watch Tailwind Config:** `npx watch-tailwind`

  - Watches `tailwind.config.*` in the background and synchronizes the Vuestic UI configuration on the fly.

- **Sync Vuestic with Tailwind:** `npx sync-vuestic-with-tailwind`
  - Transfers color and breakpoint settings from the default Vuestic UI config to the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.cjs`).

## Themes

There's currently a dark mode, light mode and secret pink mode, press cmd+k to toggle pink mode. The secret pink mode was just to test if more than 2 themes could be implemented efficiently with the current configuration without changing the dark mode switch which starts based on os preference.
